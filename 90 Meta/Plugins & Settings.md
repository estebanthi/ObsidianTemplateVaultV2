# Plugins & Settings

## Plugins

I've left in this vault template the few plugins that I find essential and useful for everyone. I use more on my side, but they are also more specific and not necessarily useful for you. 

I've already talked a lot about the plugins I use and how to use them, so I'll let you read my Medium articles in the following list if you want to know more: https://medium.com/@estebanthi/use-obsidian-like-a-pro-3946cd68cca0

## Settings

I've left the settings as I use them in my vault. I recommend that you modify them to suit your needs.
