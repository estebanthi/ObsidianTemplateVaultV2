# Templates
---
I use both Templater and QuickAdd. They work well together, but I have some QuickAdd-specific templates. So you need QuickAdd to use them, or you have to rewrite them with Templater syntax.

I've also set up a few keyboard shortcuts to create notes quickly with QuickAdd. For example, ALT + Shift + Q to create a wiki note, or ALT + Shift + S to create a MOC (try it yourself!).

If you want to know more about Templater and QuickAdd, here are two articles I wrote:
