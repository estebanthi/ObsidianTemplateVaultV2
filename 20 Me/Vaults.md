# Vaults

I write down here all the places containing information I own. This allows me, when in doubt, to know where I should store information, or where I can find the information I'm looking for.

This note requires quite a bit of thought to set up, because you have to think of everything, but once it's in place it's quite effective, and also allows you to establish a backup strategy (because yes, I backup ALL my data, but you probably don't need to be as extreme as I am).

For the example, here are the first elements of this note in my personal vault.

#### Calibre
*Calibre is just here to store books I own. It's not a to-read list, neither a read list or a place where I should store book ratings.*
