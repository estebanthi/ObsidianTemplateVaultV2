Today is the penultimate day of our roadtrip. We don't waste any time, and set off quickly in the morning to make the most of the day.

We start with a short 5-kilometer hike just outside Las Vegas, in the mountains. It's our last hike here... We come across a few lizards and Joshua trees.

After that, we head back to Las Vegas, this time downtown, to find some food. After eating at a steakhouse, we take a short walk downtown to pick up our tickets for the Cirque du Soleil show we're going to see tonight. This little stroll allows us to discover the main hotels: the Bellagio, where we're staying tonight, the Caesars Palace, the Mirage, the Treasure Island, etc... All these hotels are gigantic and luxurious, with dozens of boutiques, slot machines and all kinds of services.

On the way back, we pass by Caesars Palace again, this time in the Forum Shops. The interior is impressive, made of faux sky and decorated in Roman style, as is everything else. The shopping arcades are enormous, and you'll be walking through them for at least an hour. It's crazy to think that all this belongs to Caesars Palace, whose total surface area is around 25,000 square metres.

Then it's off to the Bellagio for check-in. We take a quick tour of the hotel to see the various boutiques. We also pass by the garden next to reception, featuring sculptures and giant animals. We also pass a bakery with a chocolate fountain.

After our little tour of the hotel, we head back to our room to relax for a while. We set off again an hour later, this time to go to the casino. Indeed, it would have been a shame to spend Vegas without having been to the casino. Fortunately, we don't lose much, and I leave with a small profit of $10.

Then it gets late and the Cirque du Soleil show is about to start, so we get underway. We pass the Bellagio fountain show, and head back to Caesars Palace to eat at an indoor restaurant. After lunch, we continue on to the Treasure Island for the show. It's very crowded, but we get through quickly.

The show we went to see was "Myst√®re", and it was really great and very impressive. The artists were top-level gymnasts, who performed tricks each more impressive than the last, and sometimes even frightening because they could injure themselves if they missed.

After that, we headed home without wasting too much time, as we were a little tired, and went straight to bed so as to be in good shape for the day of transport that awaited us the next day.
