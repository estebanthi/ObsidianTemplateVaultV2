# My Obsidian Workflow
---
This page describes my [[Obsidian]] workflow.

It's one of the workflows I tend to refine the most, so this note will never be really finished.

## Folder Structure
My [[Obsidian]] vault is composed of several distinct parts. To represent these parts, I've chosen to use folders. These folders are indexed so that they appear in a specific order in my local version of the vault (that's why their name start with a number).

- **00 Inbox**: where my new notes are created
- **10 Wiki**: my knowledge wiki
	- **11 Wiki Inbox**: inbox for everything wiki-related
	- **12 Notes**: what would be a [[PKM]] system without notes?
	- **13 Plantations**: notes made to group several notes, check [[Plantation - 20230114032002|Plantation]] for more details
	- **14 References**: the source of the knowledge in the vault and the things I want to keep track of
	- **15 Courses**: courses I follow and want to keep track of
	- **Status**: describes the status of my notes.
- **20 Me**: some vaults more related to me (a lot of things here are hidden from you)
	- **Workflows**: my workflows & processes
	- **Ideas**: my ideas (meal ideas, project ideas, etc...)
	- **Reviews**: periodic reviews
	- **Travels**: my travel log
	- **Projects**: I keep here notes related to my projects
	- **Gifts**: gifts log
	- **Goals**: goals log
- **30 Public**: everything related to my online vault
	- **31 Start Here**: for the newcomers to this website
	- **32 Updates**: I share here major update notes of my vault
- **90 Meta**: everything directly related to the vault and its maintenance
	- **Templates**: my templates (I'm can't make them public because of the way this website works)
	- **Workbench**: when I need to tinker things in [[Obsidian]], this stuff goes here (for example, this whole website was in my workbench before being deployed)
	- **Attachments**: all the files linked to notes
	- **Archives**: instead of instantly delete the stuff I think is useless, it goes here in case I need it later for some reason

## Navigation
I like to be organized, and I think a good navigation is a way to feel organized. So I make a lot of notes useful just for navigation purposes. Here are some examples:
- [[Home]]
- [[20 Me/Workflows/_INDEX|Worflows Index]]
- etc...

## Graph View
I don't use the [[Graph View]] often. I navigate through my notes mainly using folders or search.

But a thing I like with the [[Graph View]] is that it's a visual representation of how my [[Second Brain]] becomes bigger over time.

## Note Status
I sometimes characterize my notes with a status. A good example is the [[Epistemic Status - 20230112085426|Epistemic Status]] for [[My Zettelkasten Workflow]].

I also use some basic status such as a `dashboard` or `working-on` status to quickly find some important notes.

## Plugins
I try to use as few plugins as possible and to keep working with plain markdown. But there are a few plugins I can't remove, they're too important:

- **Citations**: to import my Zotero references here
- **Dataview**: so useful to query data from my vault
- **Digital Garden**: to make this website work
- **Excalidraw**: I like to make drawings instead of text sometimes to explain things
- **Linter**: to refactor quickly my notes
- **QuickAdd**: by hitting a shortcut I can instantly create a formatted note into a specific folder, isn't it powerful?
- **Templater**: it makes me save so much time when I use templates

I use some more plugins such as **Vimrc Support** but they're not so important and not for everyone.
