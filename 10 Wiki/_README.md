# Wiki
---
**The wiki section has just one aim: to help you find your notes easily and efficiently.**

## MOCs

For this, I use MOCs (Map Of Content) to group together notes about the same subject. This allows me to create a sort of hierarchical structure, starting with large subjects, and diving into the details. This is made possible by a property present in all my notes: `related-mocs`, enabling me to link one or more MOCs to a note, and even to link MOCs together.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Mathematics (MOC) > Algebra (MOC) > Equations (MOC) > Inequation (Note)
> We start from MOC "Mathematics" to get to Note "Inequation"

This is the only way I found to stay organized with thousands of notes.

## References

I like to source all my notes, so I use a lot of references in my vault. A secondary goal of the wiki is to be able to know from any note where the information in the note comes from.

I also use my vault to track references that have not yet been "consumed", such as a book to read or a film to watch. If I keep track of my references correctly, the [[Learning Center]] allows me to gather in one place all the content I plan to consume, sorted by priority. This avoids having watch lists, reading lists, playlists, etc... spread across all platforms.

For the example, I've only included two types of reference in this vault: books, and movies. More info on how to add your own types here: [[10 Wiki/14 References/_README|_README]].

## Courses

What I call a "course" is just a MOC where you manually group notes. Eventually, there will be other notes or files related to a course, not just a single index, so I create a folder for each course where I can store the relevant files. There is no specific structure to a course, that's why I create a folder for each course, it gives me flexibility and allows me to organize myself as I wish.

>[!EXAMPLE]
>An academic course about mathematics may include many topics such as algebra, probabilities, etc... I can use a "Mathematics" MOC to prepare for my exams but eventually my exams won't include all the topics related to mathematics in my vault. So I can use a "course" note such as [[10 Wiki/15 Courses/Sample Course/_INDEX|_INDEX]] to manually index the topics I have to study for my mathematics exams.


## Identifiers
I include timestamps or any other identifiers in the names of my notes. When your vault will grow, it'll probably have many notes with the same file name. Having identifiers in the files names is a way to deal with this.

So, the file names I use are formatted this way: `{{name}} - {{identifier}}`. For example: [[Sample Note - 20231031032802]].

For wiki notes I use timestamps, for books I use ISBN, for movies I use publication year, etc...

This process is automated with templates.
