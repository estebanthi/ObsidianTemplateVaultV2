# Welcome!
---
Welcome to my template vault! I hope you'll be able to use it to make a system that works for you. As for me, I've been using this structure for about 6 months now, and it seems to suit my needs perfectly. After all, it took me 2 years to arrive at this setup, which is the result of two years of experimentation, mistakes and adjustments. And funny enough, my first vaults were more complex than this one (but also less efficient, complexity is not good in Obsidian I think).

Of course, I encourage you to customize it as much as possible, and if you have any suggestions for improvement or need help, feel free to reach me out: [contact@esteban-thilliez.com](mailto:contact@esteban-thilliez.com).

This template vault is free, but if you'd like to reward me for the time spent designing it, it's obviously much appreciated! [Buy me a coffee!](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/estebanthi)
